PopMedNet&trade; is an open-source application used to facilitate multi-site health data networks. It uses a distributed network design that enables data holders to retain full control of their data. Investigators send questions to data holders for review and response. PopMedNet eliminates the need for assembling patient records in a centralized repository, thus preserving patient privacy and confidentiality.


# Statement of need

Distributed health network plays an important role in supporting a number of population health activities. 

The goal of PopMedNet&trade; is to facilitate distributed analysis of electronic health data in order to support medical product safety surveillance, disease surveilance, comparative effectiveness, quality, medical resource use, cost-effectiveness, and related studies. It does this by enabling the creation of health data networks that allows the data owners to keep and control uses of their data, while at the same time allows customized access and governance for each network.

The concerns of the network stakeholders are addressed in the design and governance models of the PopMedNet&trade; software platform. 

PopMedNet&trade; features include distributed querying, customizable workflows, and auditing and search capabilities. Its flexible role-based access control system enables the enforcement of varying governance policies.
