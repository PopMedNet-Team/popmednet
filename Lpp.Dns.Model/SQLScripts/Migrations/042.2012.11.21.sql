-- This migration is tied to the introduction of projects.
-- Before projects, all request permissions (such as Read, Delete, View Results, etc.) were applied to the
-- pair of (Organization,Request).
-- With projects, however, it now must apply to the pair of (Project,Request).
--
-- This migration updates the ACLs by replacing every orgs with projects for all requests.
