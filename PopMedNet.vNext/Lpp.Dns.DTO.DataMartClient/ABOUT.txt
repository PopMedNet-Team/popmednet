This project is strictly DTO's for communication between the DMC and DNS.Api. 
Lpp.Dns.DTO is framework 4.5, the DMC needs to stay at 4.0 hence the separate library.
The enums should match the same named enums in the main Dns.DTO project.

TODO: now that the DMC has been updated, realignment should be done to the dmc to remove the need for this project. Jul 2015
